# Cookbook Recipes
This section of the documentation attempts to provide a "learn by example" resource, by reproducing the [IIIF Cookbook](https://iiif.io/api/cookbook) recipes using the `iiif-prezi3` library.

Where possible, the helper methods and other conveniences of `iiif-prezi3` are leveraged, with secondary examples showing alternate methods of creating the recipe JSON.

If you would like to contribute to this section, please see the [Cookbook recipe examples issue](https://github.com/iiif-prezi/iiif-prezi3/issues/129) in the project's GitHub repository.
